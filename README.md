## Description

The purpose of this project was to create functioning employee tracker interface, backed by a MySQL database. The interface uses the inquirer npm package to allow the user to navigate and edit their employee database, with multiple prompts combined with the mysql npm package to perform queries on the database. The user is able to add, alter and remove departments, roles and employees from their company, while also being able to view a list of all of these things, and notably viewing employees by certain criteria (i.e. their manager or department) and seeing how much each department uses of their budget based on employee salaries.
